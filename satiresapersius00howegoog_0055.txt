22 a, renerus rtrceua [sar. ιι.

Το you, ’tis true, were silver pretenta brought,
Or graven goblets e'xquiaitely wrought
0f marrire gold, pleased with the glittering toy,
ι Your tears would gush—-yourheart would leap for joy.100
Hence you expect to bribe each God aud smear
His face with captive gold to gain his aar.
Among the brazen Brethren first be he ·
That sends the dream from grosser humours free!
Let him stand first, who first your prayer has heard,
And oh! be sure at least-to gild his heard !
The earthen vase that Numa used of old,
And brass Saturnian now makes way for gold r
To gold the antique Tuscan pitcher turns,
AndVesta must be served with gotter urna. 110
Ο minda congenial with the trodden clod!
0 hearts that never tan ascend to God !
What bear your vices even to the shrine,
And judge by thisfrail flesh of joys divine!

Nequicquamfundorurpiret nummus inimo. ⁵
si tibi crateraaargenti incusaque pingui

Auro dona seram, tuder, et pectore laero

Excutiat guttas a laetari praetrepidum cor.

Hinc illud rubiit, auro sacrat quodorato
Perducir facient nam Fratres iuter ahenea,

ι somna pituita qui purgatiarima mittum
Pracidui sunto, aitque illituum barba·

Aurum vasa Numa saturataque impuiit tra,

Venalesque uruat et Tuscum fictile mutat.
0 curva in tenir anima et coelrttium inruet!
Quid juvat hoc, templis noatror immittere morer,
Et bona Dir ex hac sceterata ducere pulpa?
