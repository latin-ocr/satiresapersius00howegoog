SATIRE VI.

SAY, has the northern blan, and winter’s l'rown
Compell'd my Bassus yet to quit the town? ,
And does he court once more in calm retreat
The lireside comforts of his ⁵*Sabine seat? ·

There does the Muse his forceful hand inspire
To wake with quill severe the elumbering l yse,

' Wen-snnunnequny’s daniprngs to naee
With manly sweetness end majestic grace l·-
That wondrons artist, who with equal truth
Chaunts the light loves and sprightly joys of youth,— 10
And now of age andhoery virtue sings„
And smites with loftier hand the Latiari stringe.

Meanwhile his friend οη warin Liguria's shore
Sits listening te the distant hillow’s soar,
While bellying c‘liffs here bere their rugged side ,
Το the rude lashings of the stormy tide 3

SATIRA VI.

Annovis jam hiuma foco ιε,Ὶ Basse! Sabino?
Jamne lyra et setrico visunt tibi pectine chordae i
Mire opifex numeris veterum, primordia renim
Atque marem strepieum fidis intendisse Latine,—
Mox juvenes agitare jocos, et pollice honesto
Egregios lusisse senes l-Mihi nunc Ligus ora
Intepet‚ hybernatque meum mare 3 ¹qua latus ingene
