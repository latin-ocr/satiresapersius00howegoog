75. Una Quiritem vertigo facit. See Sat. iii. 106. See also
the same allusion in Epictet. Arrian. B. ii. C. l. Brewster quotes ’
a hassage from Addison's Dialogues on the use of medals: ‘3 ‘l can· .
not sorbear (says Cynthio) repeating spassage out of Persius, that,
in my opinion, turns the ceremony of making a free-man very hand-
somely into ridicule. It seems the clapping awand on his head, a'nd
giving himaturn on the heel, were necessary circumstances. A .
slave thus qualified became a citizen of Rome, and was honoured
with aname more than belonged to any of his foresathers.”·

76. Tressis? Cicero in oneof his Epistles has Semissis homo. A
very similar expression of contempt occurs in Shakespear's King

John, Act. Ι. Sc. 2. “ Lest men ,should say, hook where Three.
sarthings goes l'' where he alludes to the silver three-farehing pieces¹
Ἰ current in the reign of Elizabeth. , '

83. See Epict. Β. iv. C. r. where the reasoning is exacdy si.
milas. And both very much resemble the argument of the Jews
with our Savium, in St. John's gospel‚ viii. 38, 34. ‘⁴ Whosoever

³ committeth sin, is the servant of sin. They answered him, we be
Abraham’s seed, and were heresin bondage tosny man3 How
sayest thou, ye shall be made free?''

Ι86. Mordacilotus aceto. So Hor. B. l. S. rii. 32. Italo
'perfusus aceto 3 but by no means ina similar sense.

90.Ι Masuri rubrica. -This Masurius was an eminent lawyer in

. thetimeof Tiberius, and wrote a wo'rk on the Civil Law. The
Jus Praetorium was called Album and contained the edicts of¹the ⁴

Praetors. Jus Civile was called Rubrica from the red letters used,

I suppose in she Preambles. See Quintil. xii. 3. Juvenal xiv. 192.

93. Tenuis. virgil also makes Teratsia a Dactyl, θεοῖς, Ῑ,

397.

Tenuis nec lanae per coelum vellera ferri. ‹
