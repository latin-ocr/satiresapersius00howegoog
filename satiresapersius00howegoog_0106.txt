ι, ΙΤ has puzzled all the interpretem to fnd out clearly what is
the meaning and object of this prologue· Indeed what.Ciaverius
says'of the third verse, may be applied with truth to the wholet
Huic sane versui ironia species ineat,⁸ verum adeo rubrido, at mentem
animi prope eludat: neque joco plane nn seria agat prim adner-
tera‘s. '

Even the fourth word of this prologue has afforded matter'of
contentiori. Labra proluere (says Caaauboni is to dranci the lips,
to take an immense draught. No, answers Autumnus, it' is not to
drink at all, hut to bathe the lips before drinking, as horses do.-

Owen goes still farther than Casaubdns ‘⁶ Labra proluere tsays he)
. significa to take an enormous draught: as pleno se proluit auro. Virg.
hut the aelf.c0neeited poet do'es more3 he drinks off the whole
fountain-sonte labra proluir.'’ As sar as I ean judge, Casaubonis
right in saying that the word [arelao is always used cum maximo ,

sententia incrementa .· But he goes too far when he says, ‘⁶ Non
negat praecise modico se haustu fontis sacri Musarum fuisse po-
tatum.” For why then does the poet so peremptorily resign
Pirene in the fifth verse? The fact ¹seems to be this: The poet
merely means to disclaim in their own language burlesqued the
high-down pretensions of some would·be poets of his time.

Fonte Caballina is Ovid's Unda Pegasides and Moschus’s
Πωγασιδος agoson translated into the language of satire. Bishop
Hah who is fond of imitating Persius, says in the second satire of
his Virgidemiarum,

-- The cool stream that took his endless name
From out the fertile hoof of winged steed.
