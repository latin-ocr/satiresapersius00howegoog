ΑΗ, the information which ean now be obtained con·
cerning Persius, beside those few hints which his own

· worhs afford us, mustbe looked for in the short and ,
meagre biographical sketch which is usually prefixed to ·

‘his satires. ·It has been ascribed hy some to the Gramma-
rian Probus; Salmasius assigns it to Suetonius. But
there are some contradictious and inconsistencies in it,
which, added to the ill-digested order in which the facts
are related, may induce asuspicion that it is rather a col-
lection of graduallyaccumulated notices written by dif-
ferent hands at different periods‚ than the product of any
,single pen. However this may he, it assuredly is not of
uery recent manufacture, and therefore deserves some
regard. Ι shall, theu, instead of attempting to vamp up
a new account of the Poet’s life from the old materiale,
'present the reader witha translation of this fragment,

  accompanied ¹with a few remarks. .
