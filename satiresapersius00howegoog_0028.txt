bear him decinim. 'He mentions aluo the master’s frantie exclame-
tions of applause et bis young pupil’s perfonnsnce‚ which seems
more likelyto hare proceededfrom some provincial Tutor than from
a Rhetorician at Rome. If so, it must have been before he was
twelve years old 3 for after that, the Life informs us, he was truns-¹

lt is highly amusing to bear Rumon, in his account of Persins’s
life, gravely affirm t “ After bis father's death,‘he remained at Vo-
laterre, and gave an extraordinary proof of his natural abilities, by
applying himself closely ta all finds ‘ff learning till he was swelce

Rufus whois spoken of as a teacher of Rhetoric by Tacitus,
Annxw 71, and by Pliny the Younger, L. 11. Ep. 1. where see
Melmotb’s note; and whom also Quintilian reposto to have written
