culty which yet remains in the word Succinctis.

The older Romans were rt rs well known, designated by their
posterityinthetimeof the Emperors, and even in the latter times
of theRepublic, bysuch epithets as Succincti, cinctuti, uc„ What
their cars be more natural than that the statues of these Lares or
