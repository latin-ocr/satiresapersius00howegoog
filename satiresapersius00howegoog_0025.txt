made to a good translation, at least td oue better than
any which has hitherto appeared3 for both that of
Francis and the Duncombes are very flat and insipid.
An attempt of this kind upon the Satires only of Horace¹
·(for his Epistles are composed in a very different vein,
and the humour which they contain is seldom of the
· satiric kind) 'is what Ι have for some time been bold
enough to meditate: indeed l have executed nearly
two thirds of the work3 but whether rt ever see the light,
will depend upon the receptior which the present per-
'formance shall meet with.

With respect to the following peges l wish to say as
few words as possible. Tu apologiae for undertaking a
task which hasbeen done by six or seven hands before
me, would indeed have an air of modesty in it; but after.
all, would it nothe nugatory? IfI shall really be thought
to surpass my precursors, an apolngy will be found

. in the work itself: if not, nothing that Ican say will

extenuate my audacity in supposing it possible thatl
should surpass them. Ι might also plead my residente
in the country, far from any focus of literature or
literary men, as an excuse for occasional blunders or
oversights: l might add the avocations of my pro.
fession as tutor to a few domestic pupils, the anxieties
attendinga family, &c But l would much rather throw
myself at once upon the candour of my readers, and
‚omit all such pleas for favour, as ‘ with merit 'needlesa

and without it vain.’
