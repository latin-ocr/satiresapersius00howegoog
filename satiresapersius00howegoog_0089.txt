· Eo'u utile tue tait, tte precisus momentsfly ς·
And what batnon) tuas ours,-'-is notu gone by. '300
Such is your state! By struggling passions torn, ’
This way by pieasure-'i-that by iuore borne‚- ’
As, when the fish the double buit cspies‚
¹ He hesitates to chose, then chusing dies,
So you, in doubt which tyrant to prefer,
Are doom'd, determine as you will, to err.
Nor think, because foronce perhaps or twice
You dare to struggle with your headstrong vice,

’ That iastiug i'reedom must reward the’ endeavour,

And that, if free for once, you’re free forever. 310

α . Giad of his liberty, the captive dog

0st gnawsthc rope that binds him to his clog:

Still as a badge of slavery, thece oemains

Trail'd at his neck, asemnant of his chains. ι
Donat, ’tis my resolve, I’d Itane you truta,

To put un eud ot once to all any uue.

So spolie the Lover with vexationsick,

Biting the while his thumb-naii to the quiet.

Ancipiti obsequio dominos, alternus oberres.
Nec tu, cum obnitens semel, instantique negtiis

Nam et luctata canis nodum abripit; attamen illi,

Cum fugit, a collo trahitur pars ionga cateuae.
