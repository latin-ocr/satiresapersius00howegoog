lu has ‚been usual to prefix to works of this kind
a discussion ofthe respective merits of the three heroes

of Roman satire„ Dryden has a spirited introduction of
cristino, though too much besprinkled with fulsom‘e .
‚flattery addressed to his patron. ΜΓ. Gifford also has, ,
given us in his Juvenal an Essay on the origin, progress‚
and genius of thc Roman Satira, which, with Dryden's·
prefatory Dedication, comprises all that is really va-
lrrable on the subject, exhibited in the most pleasing

form. In each perhaps is discernible alittle partipl biass Ι

, in favour of their own author, which would be very
venial, even if it were justly to be called prejudice‚—-
-but which ought not, 1 think, in all cases, to be termcd

. such. ’ There are authors who, from obscurity ofstyle or

austerity of manner, do not please much on a first
perusal, but who neverthcless, on a closer surrey, rise
'upon the reader’s esteem. The nrind is at first so em,
barrassed with perplexities, that it has sear·ch sufficient
leisure to apprehend the deuehed beauties, much less
the general spirit and effect. In examining the parts too
² ¹closely and in detail, we overloolr their nrutual relation
and the chain of thought which connects the,.whole.

Like pioneers, we are so deeply occupied in clearing
away the briars and brembles, that we lose the beanty of
the surroonding scenery. By degrees, the roggcdness
of the path is either lavelled or familiarity reconciles us ‘
