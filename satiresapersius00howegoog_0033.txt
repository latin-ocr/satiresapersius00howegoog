“ Auriculas asini Mida rex habet*‚ King Midas* lrss s
pair of ass’s ears‚” Cornutus, apprehensive lest the Ent-

peror should perceive it to be pointed-against himself, ¹

sostened into “¹ Auriculas asini quis non habet, Who hies
not now a pair of ass’s ears ?’'

¹* Casiubon, upon the authority of this anecdote, reinststes the
words supposed to hare been rejected, and Koenig follows hini. For
my own part, 1 think the snon'ymous'biographer very insufficient ἶ
authority for altering any passage of Persius. Koenig thinlre the

’ story was made up to account for a variety of the text, and it seems

very likely to be so. But 1 still think quis nos tates the original
reading. Jl'he evident allusion of Persius to. the words which
Ovid puts into 'the gossip Birber’s mouth, probably induced some
¹ one· to interline liis copy bf Persius with those words, and thus by
degrees they were foisted into the text. , Βοι quis sos habncould
neser srise fromn gloss on the words Mida rex babet. The old
Scholiast says that the four verses in Sat· 1, beginning T orna '¹
illimalloseis are Nero’s. But Cornutus would surely not. have
thought it worth his pains ιο turn off sn oblique stroke et the
Emperor, contained in the story of Midss's barber, and at the

same time have left Persius to lling Nero's 'own ¹verses in his lnce. l
