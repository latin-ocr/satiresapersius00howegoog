· 45. Grandia verba. He nieanshere to ridicule the turgid style
ol puerile declamation. The word Grandis is always applied by
Persius in an ironical sesses Thus S. 1. 14. Grande aliquid 3 and
S. ssl- Grande locuturi. The words non sano in the next verse
seem merely tobe astronger expression ,for insano, as in tbe last
verseof the present satire, Non sani esse hominis non sanus juret
Orestes. ln the sarh vers'e Casaubon points after the word Jun,

. with no great advantage (thatl can see) to the sense, and certainly

with great embarrassment to the construction. The scholiast seems
solave misus nim. ’

50. Angusta collo non falligorcae. According to some of tlte
commentators Persius here means that one of his boyish labours con-
sisted in learning how to detect his play ·fellows in the fraudulent use
of a dice-box made narrow in the neck, so that by fixing the dice
they could obtain whatever throw they wanted. Others think he al·
ludes to a garne which consisted in chucking nuts or small pieces of
money intoa narrow·mouthed jug. The latter idea seems much
more agreeable to the general sense of the passage. An exertiou
of skill was more likely toengage the zeal of so teuder a mind,
than the detection of a swindling trick. Let us hope the idle pro·
gesy of Rome was not quite so bad as to need such precaution. In ,
the manner then in whichI would understand the passage, Fallier
will signify to miss one's aim, like &pagzano in Greek. In so trilling
amatter Ihave translated freely.

53. braccatis Medis. Braccae (says Ruperti ln Juv. S. Π. 169.)
ιιοιι modo Gallis Narbonensibus in usu erant, sed et Dacis, Getis,
aliisque Ponti populis, Phrygibus, Lydis, Persis, Indis, et Medis.
Xenophon describing the dress of the Persian nobles who accompa- .
nied Cyrus in his Expedition against Artaxerxes, mentions their
notatam &sagngiheatheir embroidered or variegated trowsers, which
would doubtless form aprominent feature in the Battle-piece alluded
to by Persius. 1 need scarcely to observe that the Battle ol Marathon
was painted upon the walls of the portico in which the stoic philoso-
phers taught their disciples, for which reason it was called nonnas
msa, the painted Portico.
