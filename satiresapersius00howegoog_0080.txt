Soffly, young ‘man i-Yon taiter’d hobbiing dame

To the same question would reply the same.

Go now, and vaunt your mother's noble raco;

Boast of your beauteous form ond binoming foco!

Why be it so—Yet Baucis at hen stall, 40
Whode only soieuce is to cheat aud bouis-u

Who with hoarse cry each passing kuave addresseS,
, And trumpots forth hor cabbages and orasses,

(Say what you please, the parallel holds true)

Has just as much philosophy asyma.

Where is the man-ah! where—that dares to pry

into himself with bold impartial eye?

The uallet on his neighbour's shoulders thronn

Each snes-each turns his back upon his own.

Shouid one but ask you-'³‘ Did you over see ¹

‘⁴ Vectidius’ farma ?”-Who‘s thot? you say. “ Why he, Ι.
“ Whose mauors iu the Sabine district cover --
“' A tract of ground the kite cau source iiy over.”
T dot icc-starr’d wretcli (you cry), undose scanty ioard
Stin cheots lais belly to augment his lzoard ?

Dum ne deterius sapiat pannucia Baucis,
Cum bene discincto cantanedt ooyma vernae. ·

Sed praecedeuti spectatur mantica tergo.

“ Dives arat Curibus quantum non miluus oberret ;”
Hunc! aiu ς hunc Dis iratis Genioque sinistro!
