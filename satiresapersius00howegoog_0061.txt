28 t. eaustus unrocus. [sar. ιιιι

While the hcort whispers, what the tongue must hide
Ev’n from the wife thet slumbers at his side.
Time was, when (glad, like you, of an excuse)
lbathed my eyes with blenting olive-juice,
If loath to spout on the appointed day
The ranting stuff Ι made great Cato say,
When, nobly spuroiog Rome’s victorious iord, 80
The patriot Stoic sunk upon his sword 5-
Tho’ sure my Tutor would at every line
ln well-seign’d rapturos cry, t’wustoouderotufiue!
And, summoning his luendo, my trembling sire i
Would fondly corneto listen and admire. ,
F or why—my first desire was then to know
Which was the winning, which the losiug throw:
How much the fatal Ace would sinlr my hoard,
And how the lucky Sice would sweep the hoard3
With ivery aim to pitch the flying ball, 90
And lash the giddy top the best of all.
But you are tutor’d iu fair Wisdom's school
To try distorted nrotals by the rulo:

Palleat infelix, quod proxima nesciat uxor?
Saepe oculos (memini) tangebam patrus olivo,

Grandia si nollem morituti verba Catonis

Dicere, nou wuo multum laudanda magistro,

Quat Pater adductis sudans audiret amicis

June etenim id summum, quid dexter Senio ferret

Scire, erat in roto; damnosa Canicula quantum

Radetet3 angusta collo' nou fallier orcae ς

Neu quir callidior buxum torquere flagello.
Haud tibi inexpertum curvos deprendere moret,
