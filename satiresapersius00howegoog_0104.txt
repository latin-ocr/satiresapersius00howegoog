Thrusting my noso¹ (the wretched miser’s rask)
Into the hung-bole of some vapid coslo

How different are the joys ol different hreasts!
What this admirer and covets, that derests. 40¹
How oft, ascendant planeti mystic power,
Whose sovereign aspect rules the natal bour,
Thou, look'st oo Twim, io time—place-parents join'd,
Yet differing quite in temper and io mind !
Tlrt's oo his birth-day forced in stetero dine,
Dips his dry pot-herbs in the purchased brine,
Careful himself religiously to pour
From the spare pepperssbox a dribbling show’r.
A lad of mettle that, a jovial youth,

Squarrders ‘whole fortunes on his liohorish tooth. 50
For me, nor this nor that extreme l chose,

Neither so lavish as to throw away
v On slaves and freedmeo Turbot every da53
Nor of ateste so exquisitely fine
Tocare on Thrushes of which sex Ι dine.
Go, by thy harvest only be confined3
Be bold, and grind the corn thou hest to grind.
