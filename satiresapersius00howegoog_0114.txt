31. Quid dia poe'mata narrent. Some copies read Qui mstead ι
of Quid, perhaps with advantage to the sense. The neat word be- ’
ginning with a D might produce the error. ’

’ 36, ¹Nunc auncinis, &o ie. Shall not the very ashes of that
poet rest easier for having his compositious thus recited and tirus
applauded? All this is spoken ironically by the poet himself. So
Virg.Ecl. xes. ’

·-·---· O mihi tum quam molliter ossa quiescant*
Vestra meos olim¹ si fistula dicat amores ! ‘

As to the Phyllidas and Hypsipyles, see Ovid. Heroid. 11. ⁴·
rand VI. . ·

51. The white species of Helhbore, called Veratrum, produced
vomitings: the black was taken as a purge. ' “Utriusque (says
Erasmus) periculosa sumptio; sed albi, ut praestantior, ita pe·
riculosior. Quod ipsum tamen adeo vulgatum esse coepit, ut
plerique studiorum gratia ad pervidenda acrius quae com.
mentabantur, saepius sumptitaverint. Nominatim autem Carneades ¹
Academicus, scripturus adversum Stoici Zenonis libros, candido
elleboro superiora corporis purgare solitus legitur, ne quid ex
corruptis in stomacho humoribus ad. domicilia usque animi redun-
daret, et instantiam vigoremque mentislabefaceret.'' Both kinds
were considered a remedy for madness and melancholy.

53. The epithet Citreis expresses 'more than itimay seem at first
sight; for it denotas these conches to have belonged to the rich
and luxurious. Citron wood was in the highest esteem among the

Romans. The next in estimation was maple, at least for Tables.
See Hor. Β. 3. Sat. viii. 10.

What follows the word Citreis, will remind the learned reader oi
Hor. B. l. Ep. xix, 38. Impensis coenarum et tritae munere
mstis.

58. Ciconia. This alludes toa species of mockery in which the
fingers were collected to a point, and mosed up and down, so as to
resemble the pecking of a Stork's bill. ’ =
