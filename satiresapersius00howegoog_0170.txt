Castabon next'pmpoaes his other interpretation, calling it inter·

afterwards tella us in his Persianas Horatii imitatio, is to mean either

mori conculcata, mixed with sea-water, or mari advectura, brought ·

while authority is not for him, analogy is wholly against hiran for
expers can never be derived from experior, but is 'plainly compound·

Tarteron in his French prose tranllation seems to follow that
interpretation of Casaubon, in which expers ia taken for expertum,
and maria expers for mari advectum. Depuis' (says he) que la aas

Koenig sides with those who take maris as the genitive case of raas.

Mr. Drummond understands sapere to mean toste or salsi, in
