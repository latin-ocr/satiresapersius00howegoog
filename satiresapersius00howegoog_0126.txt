NOTES ΟΝ SAT. ll.

Ι.. Meliore lapillo: literally, record this day with a lucky stone,
that is, awhiteone· So Martial,assuring a friend that his birth·
day was as dear to him as his own, says:

Felix utraque lux, diesque nobis
Signandi melioribus lapillis.

ln another epigram, written on the return of a friend, he sayts
--hanc lucem lactea gemma notet. a, ¹

In another, wishing to express his opinion that his happy days
hed exseededin number his gloomy ones, he proceeds thus:

-Si calculus omnis hucet illuc

Diversus bicolorque digeratur,

Vincet candida turba nigriorem.

The phrase was proverbial among the Romans, and alluded to a ⁴·

curtem of the Thraciam or Scythians, or (which is very probahle)
of both. That the Romans ever actually rechoned their happy or
unhappydays in this manner, can by no means be inferred. Though
Ι arn decidedly averse from that lax principle of manslation which
some have laid down, viz. that every allusion, not exactly congenial
with modern ideas, may be discarded or changed for another more„
obvious, yet in the present instance the quaintness arising from ver·
bal fidelity would have impaired the effect of what in the original
isnotanungraeeful introduction of (rie subject. The third and ῃ
foumh linesl have taken the liberty of expanding considerably, to ⁴
avoid too much abruptness.
