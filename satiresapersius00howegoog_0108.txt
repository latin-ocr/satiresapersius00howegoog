as opposed to a soldier, and suppose that Persius means to repre·

(Πηγη a fountain, whence pagus a village, because villages were

sacro to agree with carmina understood, and affero to be used in
the sense of addo. But it seems to me that the words Ipse
⁴ and nostrum inrply something more than “ For-my own partl
bring my verses, &c.'’ I take them to slgnify, “I bring my own
verses myself.” The poet means in an ironical way to declare
hu resolution, since his claime to inspiration (aad consequendy to
