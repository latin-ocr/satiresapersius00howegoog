Bred in the Porch, and nurtured with its lore--

The Porch, with trowser’d'Persisns pictured o’er;

For which, on hnsks and homely pottage fed,

The close-cropt youth despise their midnight bed.
The'Sanrian Y has pointed to your sight

Est aliquid quo tendis et in quod dirigis arcum? 60
Ao passim sequeris corvos testaque lutoque,
Securus quo pes ferat, atque ex ternpore vivis?
Helleborum frustra cum jam cutis aegra tumebit,
Poscentes videas: venienti occurrite morbo,
