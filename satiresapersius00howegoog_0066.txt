And n'ow, the bath prepared, with bloated skin
And nomaeh gnrged, the patient plunges in ς
His throaz exhafling a sulphureum nte-m
Rank zu mephitic pool or noisome stream. 170
Buffcarcely has he touch‘d the eup’s παι-ιη brian
ΨΜ a chin tremor κίκι every limh τ
Betwixt his fingers down the gobflet slips ;
His gnashing teeth nte sever'd from his lips:
The unctuous viands fall—his hrain turns round,
And down he tumblen liseless to the ground.
Then blaze the flambenux, [hen the trumpets blow, “
With all *the splendor of a mreefflhuwz
See, on 'ilis losty conch the deur deceased,
With aromazic οὓς and ointrnents greased, 180
His cold xtffl' limbs extende-i t‘ward the gate ι
While, with—the cap of freedom on each pate,
Romans os yesterday all newly ahorn
Support his bier, and mourn—or seem to mouru.
Now thu-unt your hand within your bosom, Fool!
And feel your pulse z—Is all composed and conl?
