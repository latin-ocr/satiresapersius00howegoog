any, areyougrnea aru nu nouo art-⁴ '
To quell the passions and correct the beart?
Can youdistingulsh truth from error's dream,
And that which is from that which only seems,- 200
The sterling metal from the spurious mass,-
Truth’s ringing gold from Falshood’s tinlrling brass?
Know you, what should-and what should not, be done,-
What we are bound to follow, what to shunl· ’
That have you learnt to chelle with steady hand,—
This are you wont with blackest coar to brand l
Have you each wish within due bounds confined,
Content yet courteous—and tho' frugal kind?

γ Know you both when'to spere, and when to spend, · ι,
Mild to your slave, and pleasant to your friends-1 210
Witholding now, as time requires, your store,

Now opening all your treasures to the poor?

ll in the dirt the glittering coin you ’spy,

Say, can you pass the paltry bauble by‚- .
Soorning with greedy swallow to devour

What sweets kind Mercury throws within your power?

Frontem de rebus. Tibi recto vivere talo
Ars dediti et reri speciem dignoscere calles,
Neque aubaerato mendosum tinniat aurol
Quaque sequenda forent, quaeque evitanda vicissim,

Ea* modicus voti, presso lare, dulcis amicis?

Inque luto fixum possis transceudere nummum.

Nec glutto sorbere salivam Mercurialem ἓ
