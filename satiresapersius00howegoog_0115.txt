69.Ξ The humour of this passage, from v· 69 to 75, is almost
lost to us fronl not knowing the particular poem which is the subject

’ of his ridicule. Irnake no doubt the linea printed in Italics are

a quotation from some fachionable poem of the times, descriptive of
the country and its employnrents. The three last verses from
Unde Remus down to Lictor tulit, are the herois sensus which Persius
