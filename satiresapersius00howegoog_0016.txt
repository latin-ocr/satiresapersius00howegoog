ior their example had exerteda most peruicious influence

tended to debasc and enervate their minda by inspiriug

² of simple elegance' was lost iu an admiration of sichly
sentiment and glittering conceits. Genius and science
not only met with little or n'o encouragemeut, but (what
is worse) were degraded'into the handmaids of brutal

sensuality. This excessive degeneracy oi his times had '

evidently a p'owcrful effect, when considered as co-oper-

the world with clamorous violence3 but treats it with

disdainful jeers and tauntiug sarcasms. Persius has been .

calleda graue satirist3 but nothing can be less true.

it was the perusal of one of Lucilius’s satires which
first made Persius a satirist, and it is probable* that
'if we had ’ more of the compositione of Lucilius re-

good reason. that he claims sor his readers the adnrirers
of Eupolis, Cratinus, aud Aristophanes. .
