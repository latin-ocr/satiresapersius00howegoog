Thrusting my nose¹ (the wretched miser’s taslr)
Into the hung-bole of some vapid cast:
How different are the joys ol different breasts!
What this admires and covets, that detests. 40
How oft, ascendant planetl myst'rc power, ¹
Whose sovereign aspect rules the natal hour,
Thou look'st on Twins, in time—place-parents join’d‚
Yet differing quite in temper and in mind!
This on his birth-day forced in state to dine,
Dips his dry pot-herbs in the purchased brine,
Carefol himself religiously to pour
From the spere pepperssbox a dribbling show’r.
A lad of mettle that, a jovial youth,
Squanders whole fortunes on his liolrorish tooth. 50
F or me, nor this nor that extreme Ι chuse‚
l Determined nor to hoard nor waste, but-use .· ’
Neither so lavish as to throw away
. On slaves and freedmen Turbot every day;
Nor of a taste so exquisitely fine
'Ponere on Thrushes of which sex Idine.
Go, by thy harvest only be confined;
Bebold, and grind the corn thou hast to grind.

Grandia magnanimus peragit puer. Utar ego, utar,-
Nec rhombos ideo libertis ponere lautus,
Nee tenuem solers turdamm nome salivam.
