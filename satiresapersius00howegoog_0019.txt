throw light on a conrparison of these two writers. Horace’s
’ satires were probably sent forth, soon after they were
composed, into the hands of the public,* at least ol the
politer partos it, and were consequently read and oau-
vassed during the autbor’s own life. Persius’s on the
contrary, if we arcto believe his biographer (and the
nature of his times makes the story prohable), were re-
cited or transcribed only in confidence for a small circle
Ι of friends, and were not published till after his death.
While Horace, therefore, had to consult the laste of the ·
, public, Persius sought only to gratify tbat of a few con-
genialminds. While Horace was obliged to be upon
his guard lest he offended' his patrous, Persius could
range at perfect liberty and indulge his spleen on what·
ever subject he chose. llis friends Cornutus, Bessus,
Macrinus, Thrasea, δια, probably coincided with him ·
in their opinions on the subjecte of teste, politice, and
philosophy. To thern alone, and for thern, be wrote. ⁴

was, as he terma it, asort of well, to which, like Midas's

Beyle in his dictionary goes ‚so far as to call him the

Roman Lycophron. Some irnpute this rothe tyranny of
