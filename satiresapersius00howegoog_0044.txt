Such are tite strains which every purblind sire
Admires‚ and bide his blockhead brata admire!
And can we wonde, while such ⁴critictteach,
At that strange medleywhich infects our speech ,-
Or that vile rant, at which the coxcomb Knight
Springs from his bench half-frantie with delight i

Is the grey culprit to his trial led, · -
The sword of justice trembling o'er his head ‚³—
Hiscere is not to gain, but grace the cause,- - 170
Not his ecquittal, but the court's applause.
Pedius, thou art a ⁴Tht'ef--the’ accuser cries;
Now hearken, pmy, what Pedius replies: ·
Opposing this to that-and that to this,
He balances some neat antithesis 3
With flowers of fancy garnishes the wife,
And rounds his periods to redeam his tite:
His hearers view him with admiring eye 3

How fine t's this! how charming that! they cry: '
And are ye not ashamed‚ degenerate spawn 180
of Romulus! to wriggle thus and fawn ,θ’

Hos puerit menites patret itifundere lippos
Cum videat, quaeritne unde haec sartago loquendi 80
Venerit in linguas,-unde istud dedecus, in quo
Trossulut exultat tibi per subsellia livit?
Nilne pudet capiti non poste pericula cano
Pellem, quin tepidum hoc optet audire Decenter?
Fures, ait Pedio : Pedius quid ἒ erimina tatis
Librat in antithetis, doctus potuisse figurat.

Laudatur, bellum hoc! hec bellum! An, Romule, ceves!
