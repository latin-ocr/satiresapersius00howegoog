And there the wlld waves, slrelter'd from the-deep,
Within a spacious bay in silence sleep.

⁵ My countrymen! 'tis worth your while (l troo)

The beauties ff fair Luna’r port to lcnoto. 20
So spohe old Ennius,-so he wisely spoke,

When from Pythagorean dreams he woke3

When doubts arose, whether great Homer's soul

⁸ Had really been transmitted sound and whole,

And, having duly thro'a peacoclr past,
Was come to animate himself at last.
Here am Ι, free from every vulgar care ;
Regardleas tho' the balel'nl blast prepare
To amite my flocks; regardless‚ tho' my field
A scantier crop than some prond neighboor’s yield: 30
Nay, tho' a thousand upstarts meet my eyes,
Thai, propp'd by arta low aa their lineage, riae,-
1 scorn to fret with unavailing tage,
And stoop untimely to the yolre of age:
For this l ne'er shall sleep or sup the worse,
Or atarve my helly to enrich my purae,

Dant acopuli, et multa littus re valle receptat.
Lunai portum est opere cognoscere, cives!
Cor jubet hoc Enni, postquam destertuit ease
Mennim Quinam pavone ex Pythagoreo.
Hic ego, aecumavulgi, etquid praeparet Auster ¹
Infelix pecori; seturna et, angolut ille
Vicini nostro quia pinguior: etri adeo omnen
Ditercant, orti pejoribus, utque recusem Ι
cmm ob id minui renio, aut coenare sine uncto,
