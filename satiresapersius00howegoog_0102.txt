SATIRE VI.

SAY‚ hos the northern blast, and winter's liown
Compell’d my Bassus yet to quit the town? ,
And does he court once moreio calm retreat
The lireside comforts of his ¹*Sabine seat? ·

There does the Mose his forceful hand inspire

To wake with quill severe the olumbering lyre,
Well-skill'd Antiquity's dark oprings to trace

With manly sweetness and majestic grace 9-

That wondrons ortist, who with equal noth

Channts the light loves and sprightly joys of youth,-· 10
And now of age and hoory virtue noge,

And ‚smitess with loftier hand the Latian stringo.

Meanwhile his friend on warin Liguria's shore
Sits listening to the distant billow's roar,
While bellying cliffs here bore their rugged side -
Το the rude lashingo of the stormy tide 3

AnnoV1njan1bmma foco te,‘ Basse! Sabino?
Jamne lyra el tetrico vivunt tibi pectine chordae ἓ
Mire opifex numerio veterumprimordia renim
Atque marem strepipum fidio intendisse Latinae,—
Mox juvenes agitare jocos, et pollice honesto
Egregios lusisse aeneo i-Mihi nunc Ligus ora
Intepet‚ hybernatque meum mare ς ,φη latus ingene
