’ On Herod’s birth-day, when above-below, ’
Stuck on the greasy windows all aron, . 360
Each in fantastic garlanda quaintly crown’d,
Thic'k lights emit a pitchy cloud around,-
When withits floating tait the Tuuny·iish
Curis round the margin of some russet dish,
And the 'grey pipkin foams with sparkiing wine,—
Then move-your lips with mutterings divine3
While with the circumcised Jew yon pray,
And trembling solemnize his Sabbath-day.
Next ghosts and goblins donce before your eye,
And the crack’d agg-sheil speaks some danger nigh: 370
Then the big priest and one-eyed priestess come,
With ringing timbrel and with thundering drum,
And with a thousand fears your mind inflame
of Gods that rack the joints and bloat the frame3
Against wbbse vengeauce nothing oan suffice, κ
Save—Garlic swallow’d every morning thrice.

Such doctrines of true Freedom should you dare
Amid tbe gaunt Centurions to deniare,

Dispositae‚ pinguem nebulam vomuere lucerne, y
Portanter violatu rubrumque amplexa catinum
Cauda natat thyno‘u-tumet alba fidelia vino ς

Labra momorantur, recutitaque Sabbata pallea.
Tunc nigri lemures, ovoque pericula rupto t
Hinc grandes Galli, et cum sistro lusca sacerdot
Incurrere Deos inflantes corpora, ri non
Praedictum ter mane caput gustaveris ossi.
Dixerit haec ioter varicosos Centuriones, '
