Or what's the price for which these heavenly givers
lncline their ears ?-is it but lights and livers?
Behold‚ in ritesof due lustration skill’d‚
'l'he aunt or grandame lifts the cradlcd child : 60
That finger, first, whose pointing speaks disgrace,
Upon his forehead and moist lip they place,
With sov’reign spittle wet, instructed well
Against the witching eye to work the spell.¹
At length, all ceremonies post withjoy
They dandle in their arms the puling boy,'
Anu hail the bantling with prophetie vow
Now lord ol Licinus's lands, and now
Ol Crassus' houses :···“ Heaven be pleased to shower
“ Down on his head 'wealth, beauty, fame, and power! 70
“ May lings and queens desire him for their son !
“ May every damsel, by his beauty uon,
“ Pursue him with fond glauce, where'er he goes!
r “ And every thing he treads on he a rose !”
'Well‚ to no gossip·-rrurrie will l consign
The task ofpraying fora child of mine:

ψ

Jupiter? aut quidnam ert, qua tu· mercede Deorum
Emeris auriculas? pulmone et lactibus unctis?
Ecce, adeant metuens Divltm matertera cunis
Exemit puerum, frontemque atque udalabella
Infruni digito et lustralibus ante salivis
Eripiat, urentes oculos inhibere perita. ’
Tunc manibus quatit, et Spem macram supplice voto 35
Nunc Licini in campos, nunc Crassi mittit in aedes.
Hunc optent generum rex et regina! puelle
Huncrapr'ant! quicquid calcaverit hic, rosaflat!
