9. Some commentatore think that by canitiem and ‘viam triste
Persius means his own grey-headedness and severe mode of life, and

Koenig is of that opinion. The passage certainly is exprest with
awkward ambiguity. But Ι cannot help thinking that, taken in the

sense which 1 have adopted in the translation, and which Casauhm .

satiric spirit is infinitely higher. The reference is to the solemn
mockeries of recitation described afterwards: See particularly Δ
v. 22.-Qnintilian cites this line, B. ix. Chap. 3. Est Quia et

triste aspexi,'’ cum infinito verbo sit usus pro appellatione: moram
enim vitam vult intelligi.

96, certainly makes the general meaning of this line evidere:
Tiresias there recommending Ulysses to pay esna to the sloh ’
man, says,

Importunas amat landari? Donec oar! jam
Ad coelnm manibus sublatis dixerit, urge, et
Crescentem tumidis infla sermonibus utrem.
