NOTES ΟΝ sAT. lII.

Most of the Translatoro and Commentators wish to represent
this satire as a regular dialogus between a tutor and his pupil. The
same rsge for systematizing 'has been exerted upon the first satire,
and indeed rnore' or less upon all-the rest. Itis by this mode of

proceeding that perverse ingenuity has tortured Horace’s Epistle to ,
the Piros into a didactic poem on the art of poetry, and even Pope's
Essay on Man‘into a pious christian discourse. It is really provdk·
ing to see poetry thus wrenched and twisted into system by the
cramping irons of criticism. In satire and compositione of that fa-
miliar sort'we are not to look for a regular arrangement of parts

contbining to form one complete whole. The order observed in
, them is little more than that of common thinking or epistolsry w'rit-
ing, where one idea continually suggests another: with this restric-
tion however that the leading thought inheret wholly lost sight of.
Itis a chain indeed ; but it isa chain which runs round into itself.
