Ouryesterday’s to-morrow now is gone,
And stilla new to-morrow does corne ont
We by to·morrows draw up all our store ’
'Till the exhausted well can yield no more.'’

71. Canthum. The iron hoop or rim with which a wheel is
bound. Quintilian says (i. 5.): Barbarisrnum pluribus modis ac-
cipimus. Unum ingente, quale sit si quis Afrum vel Hispanum
Latinae orationi nomen inserat: ut ferrum quo rotae vinciuntur dici
¹ solet Canthus, quanquam eo tanquam recepto utitur Pe1·sius.” The ,
wordaccording to Burman is of Celtic origin. The Germane hare
aword Kante, signifying a corner, edge‚ or border. There is'also¹
aGreek word Kasios, which in their medical writers signifies oculi
angulus vel circulus interior. What is the connexion or what' the
common parentage of these words, it is now impossible to deter-
mine. The reader who wishes to prosecute the search may consult
Casaubon’s note. I shall only add that Ouid wishing to express the
thing denoted by the word Canthus, in his story of Phaethon, is
driven to a circumlocution. In describing the chariot 01 the Suo,
he mentions the tumme curvatura rote.

73. Libertate opus est. Here begins the stoical paradox which

, is treated with admirable good sense and no s'mall portion 01 wit to '

⁷ within three lines 01 the end of the satire. This paradox may be
seen well haodled in Epictetus's Discourses preserved by Arrian,
B. iv. C. l. where many 01 the arguments and allusione are similar

“ to those used by our Satirist. The philosophical Euripides has in·
troduceda sentiment of the like kind in his Hecuba, ν. 858. Ed.

¹ Pons. and Horace has touched the topic with exquisite spirit in those

{inclines 01 his beginning-Quisnam igitur liber? &c. 'See also
Cicero's Paradox V.

Velina; The Veline tribe wasone 01 the lowest of the Roman
tribes.

74. Publius. Slave's on being manumitted received a prenomen.
’ So Hor. B. 2. S. v. 32.
