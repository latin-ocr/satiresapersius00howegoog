“ Had but your beart escaped unhurt and whole,

“ Then, even then, you'd spnrn her base controul.’'
Thus Davus says-and justly says ; for he ἢ

That huga his feners never can be free ι 340
In vain his boasted wand the lictor waves ;

lf thealdom lurk within, we still are slaves.

' Is that man master of himself an honr,

Whom, madly panting after place and power,
white-robed Ambition leads, ignobly proud,
To cringe for votes and coax a fickle crowd?
(ἕο, with rich largesses tlte rabble plenae,
And bid them scold and scramble sor your pean ¹
, Zet your leand shows on Florn’s sesnin days
Be sach tlnt ages may record yonrpraites— 350
And future gaen-beneda prattn'ng round their fitne,
Tell their* sons’ sons ,your bonnty to their sires:
Can night be nobler ?-‘-Thns Ambition eries,
While crowds of wjlling slaves around her rise3
Her mandates trumpet-tongued she sounds afar,
And drags a thousand captives at her car.

But turn we now to Superstition’s slaveS,
And mark the wild enthusiast how he raves!

“ Supplicet, accedam ?-Si totns et integer illinc

Non in festuca, Lictor quam jactat ineptus. 175

Cretaea Ambitio ἓ- ngla, et cicer ingere large*

Rixanti populo, nostrii ut Floralia possint

Aprici meminisse senes .· qm'd pulchrius ?-At cum

Herodis venere dicae unctaque fenestra
