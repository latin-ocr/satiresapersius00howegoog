“'Doctdr,1feela ssuttering at my breast, , ’
“ With respiration hard and lungs opprest:
“ ln such acase,p1·ay what would you advise ?”
Sobriety and rest—the sago replies: 150
The third night gone, his palpitatiuns cease; ,
His pulse boats gently, and he breathes with ease. =
Regardless of his diet, straight he sends Ι
To ask some rich Surrentino of his friends:
Eun to my noble neighbour, stava cmd say
Ι deg ofluggon-I slzoll bathe to-doy.

Soon after comes the Doctor--“ Hey! my friend,

“A How now? you’re sadly pale3 why don’t you mend ?'’
No matter. “ Nay, good Sir! but (not to flatter)

“ ’Tis time that you beware of this No'MATTuss5 160
“ For by your pallid looks and morbid sizeffiy
“ ,Ι sear the water has begun to rise.’'

Physiczons lecture! Heaven ouert tlte curse!

One tutor dead and gone, now You must teaze.

⁸‘ I'Ve done-’pray, kili yourself, sir, if you piease.’' ’

Inspice, nescio quid trepidat mihi pectus, et agris
Faucibus exuperat gravis halitus: inspice, sodes—
Qui dicit medico, jussus requiescere, postquam
Tertia compositas vidit nox currere venas,
De majore domo modice sitiente lagena
Lenia loturo sibi Surrentina rogavit. ’
q] Heus, bone, tu palles. qs Nihil est. ῃ Videas tamen istud,
Quicquid id euti surgit tacite tibi lutea pellis. k 93
1Ῑ At tu deterius pallea ne sis mihi tutor = “
Iampridem hunc sepeli ,· tu restas? qs Perge ς tacebo.
